            <h3>A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit group that functions independently of any government.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. However, a child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially the mother, would be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.
              Education empowers an individual to earn their livelihood and also increases one's awareness on a range of issues. From healthcare, to appropriate social behavior, to understanding one's rights – OSHI FOUNDATION seeks to educate, empower and cultivate better citizens
